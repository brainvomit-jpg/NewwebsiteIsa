        <h1> A poem about code </h1>
        <p>
        In lines and loops, a story we weave,
        A language of logic, hard to conceive.
        Variables dance, functions take flight,
        Coding creates in the dark of the night. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
        If-else whispers of choices we make,
        While loops promise they’ll never forsake.
        Arrays align, their numbers in rows,
        Objects hold secrets no one yet knows. <br/>
        </p> 
        <h2> Second Paragraph </h2>
        <p>
        Debugging’s the battle, where patience must win,
        Hunting the bugs that hide deep within.
        Errors are riddles, challenges to face,
        A coder’s persistence, their saving grace. <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        From zeros and ones to systems so grand,
        A coder’s touch shapes the digital land.
        Infinite worlds from a keyboard are spun,
        In the art of the code, the future is won. <br/>
       </p>
